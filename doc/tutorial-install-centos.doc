\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to install ViSP from source on CentOS. These steps have been tested for CentOS 7.0 (x86_64) distribution, but should work with any other distribution as well. 

\note Concerning ViSP installation, we provide also other \ref tutorial.

\section install_centos_required Install prerequisities

- gcc 4.4.x or later. This can be installed with:
\code
$ sudo yum install gcc-c++
\endcode
- CMake 2.6 or higher that could be installed with:
\code
$ sudo yum install cmake
\endcode


\section install_centos_3rdparty Install 3rd parties

ViSP is interfaced with several 3rd party libraries. The <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/software-architecture">complete list is provided here</a>.

\subsection install_centos_3rdparty_recommended Recommended 3rd parties

We recommend to install the following:

- OpenCV
\code
$ sudo yum install opencv-devel
\endcode
- libX11 to be able to open a window to display images
\code
$ sudo yum install libX11-devel
\endcode
- lapack to benefit from optimized mathematical capabilities
\code
$ sudo yum install lapack-devel
\endcode
- libdc1394 to grab images from firewire cameras
\code
$ sudo yum install libdc1394-devel
\endcode
- libv4l to grab images from usb or analogic cameras
\code
$ sudo yum install libv4l-devel
\endcode
- libxml2 to be able to configure the model-based trackers from xml files
\code
$ sudo yum install libxml2-devel
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_3rdparty_other Other optional 3rd parties

We give also the way to install other 3rd party libraries to enable specific capabilities.

- Coin, to be able to support vrml cad model used by the model-based trackers
\code
$ sudo yum install Coin2-devel
\endcode
- libjpeg and libpng to support jpeg and png images respectively (only useful if OpenCV is not installed)
\code
$ sudo yum install libjpeg-devel libpng-devel
\endcode


\section install_centos_install_visp Install ViSP from source code
\subsection install_centos_get_source Getting ViSP source code

There are different ways to get ViSP source code:

- You can download the <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download">latest release</a> as a zip or a tarball. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using either
\code
$ tar xvzf visp-x.y.z.tar.gz 
\endcode
or
\code
$ unzip visp-x.y.z.zip
\endcode

- You can also download a <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download#snapshot">daily snapshot</a>. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using
\code
$ tar xvzf visp-snapshot-yyyy-mm-dd.tar.gz
\endcode

- Or you get the cutting-edge ViSP from <a href="https://github.com/lagadic/visp">GitHub repository</a> using the following command
\code
$ git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode

We suppose now that ViSP source is in a directory denoted \c \<source_dir\>, for example \c $HOME/visp

\subsection install_centos_config Configuring ViSP from source

- Create first a directory denoted \c \<binary_dir\> where you want to build ViSP. This directory will contain generated Makefiles, object files, and output libraries and binaries.
\code
$ cd $HOME; mkdir visp-build
\endcode

- Enter the \c \<binary_dir\> and configure the build:
\code
$ cd $HOME/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp
\endcode
A more versatile way to configure the build is to use \c ccmake, the CMake GUI:
\code
$ ccmake ../visp
\endcode
The following image shows that this command allows to configure (just by pressing [c] key) the build in a more advanced way where some options could be easily turned On/Off. It allows also to see which are the 3rd parties that will be used. To generate the makefiles, just press [g] key in the ccmake gui.
\image html img-ccmake-centos-all.png Snapshot of the ccmake \c ../visp command used to configure ViSP.

\subsection install_centos_build Building ViSP libraries

- To build ViSP proceed with:
\code
$ make -j4
\endcode

- To install ViSP proceed with:
\code
$ sudo make install
\endcode
\note This stage is optional, since ViSP could be used as a 3rd party without installation. 
\note The default install location is set to \c /usr/local. This location could be changed modifying \c CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX var. 

\subsection install_centos_doc Building ViSP documentation

- To build ViSP documentation, you have first to install Doxygen package:
\code
$ sudo yum install doxygen graphviz
\endcode
Then you can proceed with:
\code
$ cmake ../visp
$ make -j4 visp_doc
\endcode
The generated documentation is then available in \c \<binary_dir\>/doc/html/index\.html

- It is also possible to generate a more complete documentation that includes also all the internal classes. This could be achieved setting CMake var \c ENABLE\_FULL\_DOC=ON like:
\code
$ cmake ../visp -DENABLE_FULL_DOC=ON
$ make -j4 visp_doc
\endcode

\section install_centos_dataset Install ViSP dataset
Some ViSP examples and tests require data (images, video, models) that are not part of ViSP source code but available in a separate archive named \c ViSP-images-x.y.z.zip. This archive could be downloaded from http://visp.inria.fr/download page. We provide here after the way to install these data if you want to run ViSP examples.

\code
$ cd $HOME
$ unzip ViSP-images-x.y.z.zip
\endcode

We suppose now that the data are located in \c $HOME/ViSP-images.
\code
$ ls $HOME/ViSP-images
Klimt	     README.md    circle  ellipse    iv    mbt   mire-2
LICENSE.txt  calibration  cube    ellipse-1  line  mire  video
\endcode

Set \c VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH environment variable to help ViSP examples and tests to find the location of the data set. It's convenient if the environment variables is automatically added to your bash session every time a new shell is launched: 

\code
$ echo "export VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH=$HOME" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

\note For historical reasons \c VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH should not contain the folder \c ViSP-images, but the parent folder.

From now, you can try to run ViSP examples and tests. For example you can run \c displayX example that should open a windows with Klimt painting image and some overlay drawings:

\code
$ cd $HOME/visp-build
$ ./example/device/display/displayX

A click to close the windows...

A click to display a cross...
Cross position: 201, 441

A click to exit the program...
Bye
\endcode

\section install_centos_tips Tips and tricks

\subsection install_centos_tips_uninstall How to uninstall ViSP
After ViSP installation, you can remove installed material using:
\code
$ sudo make uninstall
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_tips_modules How to build only ViSP libraries

If you want to build only ViSP modules libraries, nor the examples, tutorials and tests:
\code
$ make -j4 visp_modules
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_tips_module_once How to build a ViSP specific module

If you want to build a given module and all the dependencies:
\code
$ make -j4 visp_<module_name>
\endcode
For example to build the model-based tracker module named mbt, run:
\code
$ make -j4 visp_mbt
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_tips_target Which are the targets that could be run with make ?

To know which are the target available with \c make:
\code
$ make help | grep visp
... visp_tests
... visp_demos
... visp_tutorials
... visp_examples
... visp_modules
... visp_doc
... visp_core
... visp_detection
... visp_gui
... visp_io

\endcode

\subsection install_centos_tips_3rd_party Which are the 3rd party libraries that are used in ViSP ?

To see which are the optional 3rd parties that are found during the configuration stage and that will be used by ViSP during the build you can have a look to the text file named \c ViSP-third-party.txt and located in \c \<binary_dir\>. We provide hereafter an example of a possible content of this file:

\section install_centos_issues Known issues
\subsection install_centos_issues_pthread libpthread may be hidden by files in //lib64

On CentOS 7.0 with cmake 2.8.11, during cmake configuration you may encounter the following issue:
\code
CMake Warning at src/CMakeLists.txt:80 (add_library):
   Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target visp because files in
   some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit directories:

     runtime library [libpthread.so] in /usr/lib64 may be hidden by files in:
       //lib64

   Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
\endcode
The problem was that libpthread.so exists in /usr/lib64 and in //lib64. In //lib64 it should be a symbolic link to /usr/lib64.
\code
$ ls -als //lib64
  0 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 9 Feb  4 12:16 //lib64 -> usr/lib64
$ ls -als //lib64/libpthread*
140 -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 141616 Jan 27 15:13 //lib64/libpthread-2.17.so
  4 -rw-r--r--. 1 root root    222 Jan 27 14:42 //lib64/libpthread.so
  0 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root     18 Feb  4 12:34 //lib64/libpthread.so.0 -> libpthread-2.17.so
\endcode  
The fix consists in removing //lib64/libpthread.so and creating a new symbolic link
\code
$ cd //lib64
$ sudo rm libpthread.so
$ sudo ln -s libpthread-2.17.so libpthread.so
$ ls -als libpthread*
140 -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 141616 Jan 27 15:13 libpthread-2.17.so
  0 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root     18 Feb  4 16:09 libpthread.so -> libpthread-2.17.so
  0 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root     18 Feb  4 12:34 libpthread.so.0 -> libpthread-2.17.so
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_issues_videoreader vpVideoReader is not able to read mpeg videos

On CentOS 7.0, vpVideoReader is not able to read mpeg videos. If ffmpeg is not installed (this is our case since ffmpeg is not packaged for CentOS 7.0), this class uses OpenCV to read and decode videos. Some examples or tutorials provided in ViSP hang during cv::Capture::open() call. The reason is that OpenCV 2.4.5 cv::Capture seams buggy. This is for example the case if you run:
\code
$ ./example/video/videoReader
\endcode
A work arround consists in installing a more recent OpenCV version from source. 


\section install_centos_next Next tutorial

You are now ready to see the next \ref tutorial-getting-started that will show you how to use ViSP as a 3rd party to build your own project.
